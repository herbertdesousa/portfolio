        "My love for programming started when I was a kid, I played a lot of video games and was fascinated by how games work, what happens when the player hits a coin and how that increases the score. Everything made me think and made me want to learn more about programming, so I decided to study game development and that's where I found Unity.\n\nAt 15 I got a job as a young programming apprentice, I was very excited because it was my first job. I worked a lot and learned new programming things and then I got to know Javascript, which is my love to this day, as well as SEO, NextJs, React, React Native, NodeJs, Express, NestJs among others.
